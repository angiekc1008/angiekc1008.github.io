    <div class="bio">I am a visual designer dedicated to creating art that speaks from my soul to connect with others passionate about the topics I involve myself in. My work reflects my inner self and I aim to create an experience that truly represents me. I'm passionate about many social justice issues and try to intertwine it with many of my pieces. Much of my work, however, is mainly focused on spreading positivity and opening space to share interests with people</div>

    <div class="bio">I feel like I can't do much to help a lot of the time, but what I can do is spread awareness and share my overwhelming joy and love for the world and all of its possibilities.</div>
